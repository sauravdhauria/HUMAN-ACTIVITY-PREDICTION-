stramlit.app       
This Streamlit web application is designed to predict human physical activity in real-time based on input sensor data. The prediction is made using a machine learning model (loaded from final_model.joblib) trained on wearable sensor inputs.

The app classifies the activity into one of the following categories:

Sitting on bed

Sitting on chair

Lying on bed

Ambulating (i.e., walking or moving around)
